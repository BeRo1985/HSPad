A simple AudioUnit instrument based on the PADSynth algorithm. It is
intended to sound like the characteristic pad that is all to common
in music from Hillsong United and related bands. It is capable of a
range of sounds, but the sweet spot is definitely there, and it won't
do anything very different from it.

I get the best result by setting a relatively low attack and release
time, combining it with a relatively long and prominent reverb.
